## Project Overview

Utilized Python and 'seasonal decompose'-approach on hourly meteorological data for years 1980-2019 for each county in the United States to analyze the change in time of temperature. Our analysis focuses on the TGW dataset (Jones, A. D., Rastogi, D., Vahmani, P., Stansfield, A., Reed, K., Thurber, T., Ullrich, P., & Rice, J. S. (2022) availale [here](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1960548).




## Notebooks

* In [data_preparation.ipynb](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/Is%20the%20world%20exploding%3F%20Temperature%20Analysis%20and%20Predictions%20for%20U.S.%20Counties/data_preparation.ipynb) we import the data and average over the location in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataframe
