# Analyzing Brazilian Market Expansion Feasibility: Data Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau

This repository contains code and associated files for creating an algoritm to cluster songs defined by Spotify Features.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze Magist's database, a centralized order management system, using SQL and Tableau, to gain insights into the Brazilian market. Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, aims to expand into Brazil. We assess the compatibility of Magist's marketplaces with Eniac's tech products and evaluate the efficiency of deliveries facilitated by Magist's agreement with the public Post Office. Based on the analysis, we provide recommendations to Eniac's board of directors regarding the potential partnership with Magist and the market entry strategy for Brazil using the provided CSV files as data sources.
