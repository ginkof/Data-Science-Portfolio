# Predicting Housing Prices

This repository contains code and associated files for creating an algoritm to for predicting housing prices via (un)supervised machine learning techiniques

Project Overview

The project involves building a model to predict house prices based on their characteristics. It is divided into two phases: a **classification** task to determine if a house is expensive or not, and a **regression** task to predict the exact price. The project follows a typical machine learning workflow, including understanding the context, exploring and cleaning the data, pre-processing the data, training the models, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to provide clients with reliable and efficient predictions to assist in their decision-making process.

This project notebooks can be found in the [classification](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Classification%20%26%20Regression/Predicting%20Housing%20Prices/Classification) and [regression](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Classification%20%26%20Regression/Predicting%20Housing%20Prices/Regression) folders. Here the tasks of feature engineering, model training and testing are performed.
