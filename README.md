### Data Engineering:

#### Cloud Computing
* __[Building an AWS ETL Pipeline for E-Scooter Movement Prediction](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Engineering%20/Cloud%20Computing/Building%20an%20AWS%20ETL%20Pipeline%20for%20E-Scooter%20Movement%20Prediction)__: Utilized Python and SQL for building an AWS ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for predicting e-scooter movements for Gans, a leading e-scooter-sharing startup. Leveraging web scraping, API integration, and database management, we collect and transform data from various sources. By deploying the pipeline on AWS cloud infrastructure, we ensure scalability and automation. Valuable insights and learnings are shared in a concise [Medium article](https://medium.com/@gian.inkof/data-pipelines-on-the-cloud-or-what-it-actually-means-to-extract-transform-and-load-etl-data-1ad23cd2bb6).

### Data Analysis:
* __[Optimizing Conversion Rates: A/B Testing for Enhanced User Experience
](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20/Optimizing%20Conversion%20Rates%3A%20A-B%20Testing%20for%20Enhanced%20User%20Experience)__: Utilized A/B testing to increase the conversion rate of the "SHOP NOW" button through different versions and design changes for Eniac, a tech-focused e-commerce company. By analyzing user behavior and tracking data, the project aims to optimize the user experience, improve sales, and provide valuable insights for informed decision-making.

* __[Optimizing User Engagement: A/B Testing Different Category Titles for Library Website](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20/Optimizing%20User%20Engagement%3A%20A-B%20Testing%20Different%20Category%20Titles%20for%20Library%20Website)__: Utilized Python to tests different category titles to enhance user engagement on a library website. Through click-through rate (CTR) analysis, the experiment identifies the most effective category title for an improved user experience.

* __[Analyzing Brazilian Market Expansion Feasibility:  Data Driven Businesses with SQL & Tableau](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20/Analyzing%20Brazilian%20Market%20Expansion%20Feasibility:%20%20Data%20Driven%20Businesses%20with%20SQL%20&%20Tableau)__:  Utilized SQL and Tableau to assess the feasibility of Eniac's expansion, a tech-focused e-commerce company, into the Brazilian market using data from Magist's database. Prepared a concise presentation to recommend whether Eniac should pursue a deal with Magist, considering tech product suitability and delivery speed.
