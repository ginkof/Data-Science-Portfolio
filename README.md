### Machine Learning:

#### Classification & Regression
* __[Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Classification%20&%20Regression/Predicting%20Housing%20Prices)__: Utilized Python to implement supervised techniques on a data frame containing real estate information to first classify houses in expensive or not expensive and secondly to predict the price.


#### Clustering
* __[Automating Mood-Based Playlists with Data Science](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Clustering/Automating%20Mood-Based%20Playlists%20with%20Data%20Science)__: Utilized Python to implement unsupervised techniques to automate playlist creation for Moosic, a start-up focused on personalized music curation.

### Deep Learning:

#### Image Classification
* __[Python's Green Thumb: Image Recognition and Classification of Vegetables
](https://github.com/ginkof/Python_Green_Thumb_Image_Recognition_and_Classification_of_Vegetables)__: Utilized Python to deploy a Streamlit app that uses an image classification deep learning model to identify vegetables. It generates educational text and stories about the detected vegetable using the OpenAI API.

### Data Science:

#### Data Cleaning
* __[Unveiling Business Insights: Data Cleaning and Analysis for Optimal Decision-Making](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Unveiling%20Business%20Insights:%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Analysis%20for%20Optimal%20Decision%20Making)__: Utilizing Python, this project applies advanced data techniques, including data cleaning, classification, and analysis, to provide actionable insights on product categorization, pricing distribution, discounts, seasonal trends, and data collection improvements for Eniac, an e-commerce tech company.

#### Recommender System
* __[Can Python catch Your Taste? Personalized Recommender Systems for WBSFLIX DVD Store](https://github.com/ginkof/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Can%20Python%20catch%20Your%20Taste%3F%20Personalized%20Recommender%20Systems%20for%20WBSFLIX%20DVD%20Store)__: 
Utilized Python to create personalized recommender systems for WBSFLIX, an offline DVD store transitioning online. By leveraging the store's database, the goal is to deliver tailored movie recommendations, similar to Netflix.

### Data Engineering:

#### Cloud Computing
* __[Building an AWS ETL Pipeline for E-Scooter Movement Prediction](https://github.com/ginkof/Building-an-AWS-ETL-Pipeline-for-E-Scooter-Movement-Prediction/tree/main)__: Utilized Python and SQL for building an AWS ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for predicting e-scooter movements for Gans, a leading e-scooter-sharing startup. Leveraging web scraping, API integration, and database management, we collect and transform data from various sources. By deploying the pipeline on AWS cloud infrastructure, we ensure scalability and automation. Valuable insights and learnings are shared in a concise [Medium article](https://medium.com/@gian.inkof/data-pipelines-on-the-cloud-or-what-it-actually-means-to-extract-transform-and-load-etl-data-1ad23cd2bb6).
